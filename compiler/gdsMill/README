README BY TOM GOLUBEV

gdsMill was adapted from gdsMill by Michael Wieckowski.

gdsMill allows one to work with GDS files, opening, reading, writing and altering.
It is a library and does not work by itself.  To get started, refer to ExampleUserDir.
To look at sram compiler related example, refer to the sram_examples subdir.

gdsMill takes a layermap, in a standard format (virtuoso .map files).  This is necessary
for drawing text and rectangles, since those functions take layernames, and gdsMill needs layer numbers.


gdsMill funcionality:

The main functions are from vlsilayout.  They allow creating a new layout, fill in a box, text, and instancing other structures.

Files:

 sram_examples:

	gdsMill.sh:  Adds gdsMill to python path. 
		Source this before working

	printGDS.py: will dump a text version structures within the gds file. 
	  usage: python printGDS.py file

	cell6tDemo.py: Will tile cell6t from sram_lib2.gds and output into layoutB.gds. All cells from source are copied into layoutB.gds.
	  usage: python ./cell6tDemo.py
